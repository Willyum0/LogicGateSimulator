# LogicGateSimulator
A circuit simulator that allows users to setup logic gates in a circuit to identify the behaviour of the circuit.

## Setup
The application was developed in java, using the JFrame and JPanel libraries. Currently, there is a couple of logic gates to choose from. These were designed in a way to allow for logic gates to be added in the future. 
The logic gates can be selected from the sidebar and placed on the circuit board, and wires can be placed freely on the circuit board, as well as connect to other nodes that are apart of logic gates.
